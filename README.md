# CatPhotoApp
Cat photo app for freecodecamp responsive web design path

I learned most of the topics through the Odin Project and decided to do this project as extra practice. Additional things I learned about were section, figure, figurecaption, and form.
Notes for next time:
- Remember to use "<li>" for each bullet point or number
- Remember to use required within input for text input fill out form 
- May need to review a href open new page when link is clicked
- Will likely need to review syntax for a form
- Remember footer comes after "<main>"
